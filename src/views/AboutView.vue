            <h3 >Simple???</h3>

            <p>It started simple- complete a capstone project, but the vision grew beyond simple.</p>

            <p>So although it all started out as a project to 'log' how far i've come as a FrontEnd Designer, there's no reason for Chatter to remain as such. As a result, i had to consider how to approach the project.</p>

            <h4 >The Approach</h4>

            <p>I definately didn't want a project that will end up burried somewhere on my local, so i approached it as a project to solve a personal problem- creation of wealth.</p>
            <p>However, wealth only flows towards the direction of quality service ... and there, the vision became bigger than just 'another capstone project'; the mission is now to create a space where new-techies can find their footing fast... with the help of 'old'-techies.</p>
